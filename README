Gas Turbine Propulsion Toolbox
Version X.X.X

Copyright 2016 Christopher Chinske

Overview
--------

The Gas Turbine Propulsion Toolbox (GTPT) is a collection of programs
that can be used to study gas turbine engine performance.  The
programs are implemented as GNU Octave functions and scripts.  However,
the programs should run correctly in MATLAB, and any problems running
the programs in GNU Octave or MATLAB are considered as bugs.

GTPT is based on the engine models contained in Aerothermodynamics of
Gas Turbine and Rocket Propulsion (Third Edition) by Gordon C. Oates.
GTPT reproduces some of the functionality of the Engine Cycle Analysis
Program (ECAP) and the Engine Off-Design Performance Program (EOPP),
which are distributed with the book by Oates.

Installation
------------

To build a release, check out the desired release branch (or tag) in
the git repository.  Execute the mk-release script, which will
generate a GNU Zip tar file.

If you downloaded a .tar.gz file, or if you built a .tar.gz file as
described above, extract the package.  Copy all of the GTPT files and
folders to a convenient location, and add that location to your GNU
Octave (or MATLAB) path.
